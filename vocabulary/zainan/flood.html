          写实风格，描绘了一金发小男孩漂浮在湍急的水流中，紧紧拥抱着一本《BIBLE》。他躺在一根漂浮的木头上，双眼紧闭，面部带着疲惫，却安详的睡着。男孩的头发湿漉漉的粘在额头上，衣物湿透紧贴身体， 背景是一片波涛汹涌的深蓝色海洋，整体色调沉重而压抑。

          A street in downtown Montclair, New Jersey. From the air, the sky was raining very heavily, flood scenes, very deep water on the roadway, causing the ground to crack, the street pavement cracked in multiple places creating a huge hole, and a large amount of flood water stored on the roadway poured out into the huge pit. There are no cars or pedestrians around as vehicles avoid the cracked pothole. The scene captures extreme weather events in full swing, with heavy rains causing more flooded areas along some of the city's roads, adding chaos to the cityscape. A few cars in the distance, trying to avoid getting wet from the pouring floodwaters. This scene captures a real scene moment. High resolution photography. --ar 38:53

          The photography is documentary-style, a modern coastal city, with buildings scattered naturally on the seashore, and the streets blending into the coastline. From the right side of the picture comes an extremely huge wave, as tall as a skyscraper, with rolling and roaring waves, like a moving water mountain, rushing towards the city with overwhelming force. The waves are splashing, the mist covers the sky, and the nearby buildings appear small and fragile under the shadow of the huge waves. The clouds in the sky are violently surging, gloomy and deep, further highlighting the oppression and fear of the disaster. The details of the picture are realistic, showing the infinite threat of natural forces, with a strong sense of doomsday surrealism, and the overall composition is natural and smooth.

          "A flooded American city street, with several cars soaked in icy water, surrounded by snow-covered buildings. One car was almost completely submerged, and the roof of another car was covered with snow. A 'No Trespassing' sign stood in the middle of the flooded street. Trees without leaves lined the street, and the surrounding environment gave off a cold winter atmosphere, with some debris floating in the water."
